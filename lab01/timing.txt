/* The executing time for useIntList goes larger as the Input Size increases, while there seems no difference for sort.
According to the data we"ve collected, it takes the most time for sorting random sequences, while the least for sorted sequences. The reason for this result is likely to be for the completely random sequences, the program runs more iterations to sort the sequence than any others.
